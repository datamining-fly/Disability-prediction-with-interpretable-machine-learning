# Disability-prediction-with-interpretable-machine-learning
What the project does?
This project utilized random forest and two interpretability methods (1. The built-in variable importance measure of random forest, 2. The SHapley Additive exPlanations [SHAP] method) to construct disability prediction models and identify important predictors of disability.

Why the project is useful?
This project provides the step for constructing machine learning models with the Python tool. Especially, we utilized interpretability methods to investigate the individual and contextual predictors of disability. The identified predictors are helpful for understanding the risk factors of disability, which can further be helpful for early prevention and policymaking.

How users can get started with the project?
Users can follow the steps of this demo, which gives an example for data loading, data splitting, data preprocessing, model construction and evaluation, and interpretability analysis.
